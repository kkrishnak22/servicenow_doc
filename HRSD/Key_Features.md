### HR Cases

HR cases are digital records for handling employee requests. For example, if an employee needs help with benefits, HR creates a case to note details, add comments, assign tasks like updating records, and communicate directly until resolved.

### Auto Case Assignments

This feature automatically routes new HR cases to the right agent based on skills. For instance, a case about payroll issues would go to an agent skilled in finance, ensuring quick and expert handling without manual reassignment.

### HR Bulk Case Requests

Bulk cases handle issues affecting many employees at once, avoiding individual tickets. An example is a company-wide payroll error; instead of hundreds of separate cases, one bulk case tracks the fix, sends updates to all affected, and closes everything together.

### Employee Document Management

This add-on tool controls HR-related documents with features like retention policies and legal holds. For example, it manages nondisclosure agreements by setting how long to keep them, allowing signatures from employees or managers, and locking documents during disputes to prevent edits.

### HR Dashboards and Analytics

Dashboards show static reports of HR data, like current case counts, while Platform Analytics tracks trends over time. An example is using analytics to see if case resolution times are improving or spotting seasonal patterns, such as more vacation requests in summer.

### Employee Center Pro

This paid portal lets employees submit HR requests and access services. For example, an employee might log in to request time off, view personalized content, or chat for help, with the portal customized to match the company's branding.

### Manager Hub

Manager Hub consolidates team data into one spot beyond basic dashboards. A manager could use it to quickly check pending tasks, team performance trends, or urgent HR issues, like approvals needed for promotions.

### Now Mobile App

The app allows mobile access to HR services, similar to desktop portals. Employees can submit cases, chat with agents, or upload documents on their phones; for example, a field worker might report an issue and attach photos while away from a computer.

### Employee Forums

Available with Employee Center Pro, these are collaboration spaces for employees. Examples include posting questions, reading company blogs, or watching training videos, fostering knowledge sharing without formal HR involvement.

### Alumni Service Center

This portal keeps connections with former employees, volunteers, or contractors. For instance, ex-employees could access resources like reference letters or stay updated on company news through tailored content.

### Integrated Chat and Virtual Agents

Chat features include basic bots for quick help and advanced ones using machine learning for natural conversations. An employee might chat about leave policies, and the bot could provide answers, suggest articles, or escalate to a live agent if needed.

### Knowledge Articles

These are searchable help articles created by HR for self-service. For example, if an employee searches for "how to update address," relevant articles appear, potentially resolving the issue without creating a case; agents can also attach them to emails.

### Campaigns

Campaigns send targeted content to specific groups. In a merger scenario, HR could create audiences (like by department) and bundle emails, videos, or tasks, ensuring only affected employees get instructions to re-sign contracts.

### Email Integration for Cases

Incoming emails auto-create cases, with options for machine learning to categorize them. For example, an email about a benefits question gets analyzed and routed directly to the right agent, skipping manual review.

### Lifecycle Events

This manages complex, sequenced HR processes like onboarding. For a new hire, it could schedule day-one tasks (sign forms, watch videos) and day-seven follow-ups (training sessions), automating the flow without custom setups.

### Integrations

Pre-built connections link to external tools like DocuSign for secure digital signatures. An example is sending a contract to a new employee via integration; they sign digitally, proving authenticity and preventing alterations.

# HR Service Delivery: Complete Guide to Key Features

This document provides a comprehensive overview of HR Service Delivery features, explaining how modern HR departments can streamline their operations and better serve employees through digital tools and automation.

## Core HR Case Management

### HR Cases

HR cases are the foundation of digital HR service delivery. Think of them as digital folders that contain everything related to an employee's request from start to finish.

**Detailed Example:** Sarah from Marketing needs maternity leave. An HR case is created that includes her original request, notes from conversations with her manager, tasks assigned to HR (update benefits, arrange temporary coverage), communication logs, and final approval documentation. Everything stays in one place, making it easy to track progress and reference later.

### Auto Case Assignments

This intelligent routing system ensures cases reach the right expert immediately, based on skills and specializations.

**Detailed Example:** John submits a case about 401k investment options. The system recognizes keywords like "401k" and "investment" and automatically assigns it to Maria, an HR agent certified in retirement planning. Meanwhile, a case about workplace harassment goes directly to David, who specializes in employee relations and compliance issues.

### HR Bulk Case Requests

When system-wide issues affect multiple employees, bulk cases prevent chaos and duplicate work.

**Detailed Example:** The payroll system crashes, affecting 500 employees who didn't receive their paychecks. Instead of 500 individual cases clogging the system, HR creates one bulk case titled "Payroll System Failure - March 15." All affected employees are linked to this single case. When HR resolves the issue and processes payments, one update notifies all 500 employees simultaneously, and one case closure handles everything.

## Document Management Solutions

### Employee Document Management

This premium add-on provides sophisticated control over HR documents with legal-grade security and tracking.

**Detailed Example:** During onboarding, new hire Jennifer receives a non-disclosure agreement through the system. The document has a 7-year retention policy, requires her digital signature, and her manager's approval. If Jennifer later gets into a legal dispute with the company, HR can place a legal hold on all her documents, making them read-only and preserving them exactly as they were for court proceedings.

## Analytics and Reporting

### HR Dashboards vs. Platform Analytics

Dashboards show current snapshots while Platform Analytics reveal trends and patterns over time.

**Detailed Example:**

- **Dashboard View:** Today we have 25 open cases, 15 closed this week, average resolution time of 3 days
- **Platform Analytics View:** Over the past year, case volume spikes 40% every January (annual review season), resolution times have improved from 5 days to 3 days, and benefits-related cases increase 60% during open enrollment periods

This trend data helps HR plan staffing and prepare for busy periods.

## Employee Access Portals

### Employee Center Pro

This premium portal serves as employees' primary gateway for HR services, customizable to match company branding and workflows.

**Detailed Example:** TechCorp customizes their Employee Center Pro with their logo, colors, and specific services. Employees see options like "Request Time Off," "Update Personal Information," "Access Pay Stubs," and company-specific items like "Reserve Conference Room" or "Order Business Cards." The interface matches their company website, creating a seamless experience.

### Manager Hub

This consolidated dashboard gives managers a single view of their team's HR-related activities and needs.

**Detailed Example:** Manager Lisa logs into Manager Hub and immediately sees: 3 team members waiting for performance review approvals, 2 pending time-off requests requiring her approval, 1 team member whose benefits enrollment deadline is approaching, and analytics showing her team's average case resolution time compared to company averages.

## Mobile and Communication Features

### Now Mobile App

The mobile app extends full HR functionality to smartphones, enabling on-the-go HR interactions.

**Detailed Example:** Construction supervisor Mike is on a job site when he needs to report a safety incident. Using the mobile app, he creates an HR case, takes photos of the incident scene, uploads them directly to the case, and starts a chat with the HR safety specialist. The HR agent receives everything instantly and can respond with immediate guidance while Mike is still on-site.

### Employee Forums

Social collaboration spaces where employees share knowledge and experiences.

**Detailed Example:** In the "New Parent Support" forum, employees share tips about using parental leave, daycare recommendations, and work-life balance strategies. The "Tech Tips" forum helps employees troubleshoot common IT issues without creating formal cases. HR monitors these forums to identify common questions that might need new knowledge articles.

### Alumni Service Center

Maintains connections with former employees and external stakeholders.

**Detailed Example:** Former employee Janet left on good terms and now works as a consultant. Through the Alumni Service Center, she can access reference letter requests, stay updated on company news, and maintain her professional network. Contractors and volunteers also use this portal to access relevant resources and stay connected.

## Intelligent Automation Features

### Integrated Chat and Virtual Agents

Multi-layered chat support from basic bots to advanced AI-powered assistants.

**Detailed Example:**

- **Basic Level:** Employee types "How do I change my address?" Bot responds with a link to the address change form and step-by-step instructions.
- **Advanced Level:** Employee types "I'm having trouble with my manager and considering filing a complaint." The AI recognizes the sensitive nature, asks clarifying questions, provides information about company policies and resources, and immediately escalates to a live HR specialist trained in conflict resolution.


### Knowledge Articles

Self-service resource library that reduces case volume through proactive information sharing.

**Detailed Example:** HR creates comprehensive articles like "Complete Guide to Maternity Leave" covering eligibility, duration, pay calculations, and return procedures. When employees search for maternity leave information, this article appears immediately. The system also suggests this article when someone starts creating a maternity leave case, often resolving their question before a case is needed.

## Targeted Communication

### Campaigns

Sophisticated communication system for distributing targeted content to specific employee groups.

**Detailed Example:** MegaCorp is acquired by GlobalTech. HR creates a campaign with multiple audiences:

- **Audience 1 (US Employees):** Receives information about benefit changes, new holiday schedule, and US-specific compliance training
- **Audience 2 (International Employees):** Gets region-specific information about local law changes and different benefit transitions
- **Audience 3 (Managers):** Receives additional content about leading teams through transition, new reporting structures, and communication guidelines

Each group gets exactly the information they need, when they need it, through their preferred channels.

## Process Automation

### Email Integration

Automatic case creation from employee emails with optional AI categorization.

**Detailed Example:** Employee emails HR with subject "Help with dental benefits." Without AI, this creates a generic case that HR must manually categorize and assign. With predictive intelligence, the system reads the email content, recognizes it's about dental benefits, automatically categorizes it correctly, and assigns it to the benefits specialist, saving time and ensuring faster response.

### Lifecycle Events

Structured management of complex, multi-step HR processes.

**Detailed Example:** New employee onboarding lifecycle event:

- **Day -7:** Send welcome email with first-day instructions
- **Day 1:** Assign office tour, provide equipment checklist, schedule IT setup
- **Day 3:** Check in meeting with manager, assign initial training modules
- **Day 7:** Benefits enrollment session, complete remaining paperwork
- **Day 14:** 2-week feedback session, assess additional training needs
- **Day 30:** Full performance goal setting, integration assessment

Each step triggers automatically at the right time, with fallbacks if tasks aren't completed.

## External Integrations

### Third-Party Service Connections

Pre-built connections to popular business services that extend HR capabilities.

**Detailed Example:** DocuSign integration allows new hire contracts to be sent directly from the HR system. When HR creates an onboarding case, the contract automatically generates, sends to the new employee via DocuSign, tracks signature status, and stores the completed document back in the HR system. The integration provides legal-grade proof of signature authenticity and document integrity, essential for employment law compliance.

## Summary

These HR Service Delivery features work together to create a comprehensive digital HR ecosystem that improves efficiency, employee satisfaction, and compliance. The combination of self-service options, intelligent automation, and integrated workflows transforms traditional HR operations into a modern, responsive service delivery model that scales with organizational growth and adapts to changing business needs.

# SPEAKER: Now we will look at some of the key features of HR Service Delivery. We'll be looking at most of these features more in depth in the later modules. However, there will be some that we don't. A brief explanation of some of these features will be provided.

In the earlier demonstration, a quick overview of an HR case is presented. Essentially, this process allows us to document an employee's HR request, which includes the ability to take notes, interact directly with the employee, send out tasks, et cetera, as needed. So an HR case is basically there to capture all of the details about what is required for the employee, note it, send out tasks, and then action it. We will be looking at this more in depth later.
Auto case assignments-- as mentioned earlier, we would like to make sure that, when a case is created, it goes to the correct HR agent with the correct skill. So later, we will look at how you can create these HR skills and then assign them to the appropriate HR agents as they gain those skills. When a case is created, we must have a mechanism in place that will make sure that that type of case goes to an agent with the correct skill.
HR bulk case requests-- just imagine we had a system failure, maybe a payroll failure. Well, we could have an HR service called, say, payroll discrepancy. But would we want all of their employees to create that case? Probably not. So what we could do is create a bulk case, and that will be the case for all of the affected employees. This will mean that we will be able to work on just one case. It will then update, send out notifications appropriately, and then close one case. We'll be doing this later.
Employee Document Management-- remember, this is the added subscription application that you can have in our environment. It gives us the ability to have more control over the documents that HR needs to deal with. What sort of documents are we talking about? Nondisclosure agreements, for instance, or any document that either an HR agent needs to sign, managers need to sign, or the employee needs to sign, or, for that matter, just to see.
So we can control things like the retention policy, how long we're going to keep those documents for. We can even put legal holds on individuals so that, if they are in dispute with a company, as an example, we can make all of their documents noneditable for legal reasons.
Later in this course, we will explore HR Dashboards, reviewing the existing dashboards, and demonstrating how to create new ones. We will also look at HR Platform Analytics. It's important to understand the difference between reports and Platform Analytics. Reports typically display a snapshot of the data in a table, providing a static view of the information at a specific point in time.
In contrast, Platform Analytics collects data over time, allowing for the visualization of trends. Are we getting faster at closing these types of cases? What types of cases occur at different times of the year? We can see odd patterns inside what has happened with our cases or anything related to Platform Analytics. We'll examine this more in depth later.
Employee Center Pro-- this is an added subscription. This is the place where, if you have it, your employees will come here and create their HR cases. We'll look at this more in depth later. We'll also see how you can interact with this particular portal from an HR admin perspective. This portal will look different depending on your company. It may be configured or customized to look or react differently.
Manager Hub is an application that goes beyond what you can see with dashboards, and dashboards show us reports and performance analytics. But that data is spread over many reports, et cetera. Manager Hub gives us the ability to summarize and put that data into one location. So a manager has just one place to go to see what is happening inside their team, what needs to be supported, and what needs to be engaged with. This is an extra application that you may or may not have.
The Now Mobile app-- in most cases, the employee will be using their desktop to access the HR portal, calling up on their phone, or sending an email to raise an HR case, but also responding to that HR case or the tasks sent to them, or communicating with the HR agents. All of this can also be done with our Now Mobile app. So an employee can raise a case, chat with the HR agent, attach attachments and documents for the HR agent to see.
HR agents can also interact with employees through the app, providing a seamless way for both parties to manage and respond to HR cases and tasks. This gives employees an alternative, mobile-friendly method to engage with the HR team and handle their needs.
The Now Mobile app-- in most cases, the employee will be using their desktop to access the HR portal, calling up on their phone, or sending an email to raise an HR case, but also responding to that HR case or the task sent to them or communicating with the HR agents. All of this can also be done with our Now Mobile app. So an employee can raise a case, chat with the HR agent, attach attachments and documents for the HR agent to see.
HR agents can also interact with employees through the app, providing a seamless way for both parties to manage and respond to HR cases and tasks. This gives employees an alternative, mobile-friendly method to engage with the HR team and handle their needs.
If you've got the Employee Center Pro, employees have access to employee forums as well. These forums are where employees can collaborate. They can read blogs, ask questions, watch videos, et cetera. It's a standard forum, and it's available on the Employee Center Pro.
Alumni Service Center-- through the Alumni Service Center, ASC portal, employees can stay connected with former employees and nonemployees like volunteers and contractors. The ASC provides unique content and services for all users to obtain information and maintain communication.
In the Employee Center or Employee Center Pro, you'll find an integrated chat capability with two main layers. One is the basic virtual agent which uses chatbots to assist employees. Employees can access the portal at their convenience, open the chat window, and enter information about what they need. The chatbot will respond and engage in conversation, offering answers or assistance.
The chat agent can create a case, send them to a live HR agent on the employee's behalf, or even provide relevant knowledge-based articles. This system can be further enhanced with machine learning, and we use what's called natural language understanding machine learning. This makes the chatbot more interactive, accurate, and lifelike, making it feel like the employee is chatting with an actual human agent. While we won't go into detail about in this course, it's important to note that basic chatbot functionality and advanced machine learning capabilities are available.
At some point, typically, an HR admin or designated knowledge manager will be responsible for creating and maintaining articles. These articles can then be used to respond to employee inquiries through the HR Service. Employees can search for articles directly in the portal, describing what they need help with. The system will automatically search for relevant articles using various methods, including machine learning.
The most appropriate articles will be presented to the employee based on their security permissions. This system aims to provide employees with immediate access to helpful information. For example, if an employee is about to create a case, an article that answers their question will be displayed, potentially eliminating the need to create a case. Additionally, when resolving a case, an HR agent can attach an article to provide further information to the employee. This article can be sent via email or made available directly in the Employee Center Pro, which we'll see later.
Now, sometimes HR departments need to push out targeted content. Let's say, for instance, that something significant is happening in your company. It could be that you had been purchased by another company, for instance. And there's going to be a lot of learning that needs to happen about this. A lot of information might need to be sent out to the employees.
For instance, employees might need to do some activity, such as re-signing their employment documents. There could be anything along these lines. Now, typically, this would not be easy to manage. We usually do it with emails. And we've got a very difficult task ahead of us to make sure that the right people get sent the right information about looking at videos. There might be meetings that need to be attended but only by certain people, for instance, and at different locations at different times.
So we have an application called Campaigns. And the Campaigns application is designed for you to have the ability to control this targeted content to be sent out. It's controlled by audiences, which basically define who is going to get this particular content. And it goes down via bundles and then via the content. And so that different audiences will see different information sessions. They'll see different emails. They might be sent links for particular videos, et cetera. We will not be covering this in this course, but you should be aware of them.
One of the ways that we can receive HR cases is via email. When this is configured, emails are automatically turned into general inquiry cases by default. An HR agent then reviews the email, recategorizes the case, and assigns it to the appropriate agent. However, if predictive intelligence capability is set up in your environment, machine learning can enhance this process.
The system can analyze the content of the email and automatically determine the correct category for the case right from the start. This allows the case to be accurately categorized and instantly assigned to the appropriate agent without manual intervention.
As mentioned earlier, some HR services involve complex processes with multiple tasks, approvals, and documentation. For example, in an onboarding process, specific tasks need to be completed in a set order. On day one, the new employee might receive documents to read, watch required videos, and follow certain procedures. Then, on day seven, additional materials may need to be reviewed, and more documents might need to be completed.
While it's possible to handle these tasks with standard HR cases, creating the necessary workflows and configurations for such complex HR events can become cumbersome. This is where a Lifecycle Events come in. Lifecycle Events are designed to streamline and manage these series of tasks in a more structured way. With a Lifecycle Event, you can easily set up and control these activities, ensuring they are carried out in the right sequence and at the appropriate times without any complexity.
Now, we have many integrations already written and available for our customers. DocuSign is a great example. DocuSign is a service that allows people to digitally sign documents as opposed to electronically signing them. Digitally signing them means that there is legal proof that that document, for one, has been signed by the correct person. They can't deny that they signed it, and that the document has not been changed since it was signed.
And so, typically, when this product has been implemented at a customer, if they require the ability to have the digital signing of documents, these will be documents that were perhaps sent out to a new employee or a prospective employee or an existing employee, then an integration can be written out to DocuSign to bring that capability into our system. We have lots of integrations available out there.

Understand the above transcript and give me complete document in simple terms with detailed examples im an indian so pl give examples in detailed way and clear use examples and complete examples also dont miss anything everything is imp

Here is a complete, simple explanation of the HR Service Delivery features with clear, India-specific examples. It covers every item mentioned in the transcript without missing anything.

### What it is

HR Service Delivery is a set of tools that help HR teams capture employee requests, route them to the right people, manage documents, communicate updates, and track performance—all in one system.

### HR cases

An HR case is a digital file for an employee’s request with notes, conversations, tasks, and resolution.

- Example (India): Priya from Pune wants to change her bank account for salary credit. HR creates a case, asks Priya for a cancelled cheque, assigns a task to Payroll to update bank details, confirms with Priya via comments, and closes the case with a record for audits.
- Example (India): Arjun requests a PF transfer from his old employer. HR logs the case, attaches instructions, assigns tasks to the Benefits team, updates Arjun on progress, and stores the final proof.


### Auto case assignments

New cases are automatically routed to the HR agent who has the right skill or specialization.

- Example (India): A case mentioning “EPF transfer” is auto-assigned to a benefits specialist; a case about “POSH complaint” goes to an employee relations expert; a case about “salary tax TDS Form 16” goes to the payroll-tax specialist.


### HR bulk case requests

When a common issue affects many employees, HR creates one bulk case instead of hundreds of individual cases.

- Example (India): A payroll system error underpaid 1,200 employees across Bengaluru and Mumbai. HR opens one bulk case, links all affected employees, posts updates once, triggers SMS/email notifications to everyone, and closes a single case when fixed.


### Employee Document Management

An add-on to control HR documents (who can see/sign them, how long to keep them, and legal holds).

- Example (India): Offer letters, NDAs, background check reports, and relieving letters are stored with a 7-year retention policy. During a labour dispute, HR places a legal hold on an employee’s documents so they can’t be edited or deleted.
- Example: Multiple signers—candidate signs the offer, manager signs approval, and HR signs final confirmation—are tracked in one place.


### Dashboards vs Platform Analytics

| Topic | Dashboards (Reports) | Platform Analytics (Trends) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Nature | Snapshot at a point in time | Data over time to see patterns |
| View | Tables and counts | Trends, seasonality, time-to-resolution |
| Use case | “How many open cases today?” | “Do leave-related cases spike during Diwali?” |

- Example (India): Reports show 85 open cases today; Analytics shows that benefits cases spike during March–April (tax-proof submission), leave cases increase during Diwali and summer vacations, and onboarding times improved from 10 to 7 days over six months.


### Employee Center Pro

A premium, branded portal where employees raise cases, track status, and access services.

- Example (India): Employees log in to request reissue of Form 16, update address, ask for LTA policy, download payslips, and check FAQs. The portal uses company logo, colours, and custom menus.


### Manager Hub

One place for managers to see their team’s HR items and take action.

- Example (India): A team lead in Hyderabad sees pending leave approvals, onboarding tasks for a new joiner, upcoming confirmation reviews, and team case queues, all in one view.


### Now Mobile app

A mobile-friendly way to do everything the portal does—create cases, chat, upload documents.

- Example (India): A sales executive on the road in Delhi snaps a photo of a medical bill and raises a reimbursement case from the app. The HR agent chats back with clarifications and closes it once processed.


### Employee forums (with Employee Center Pro)

Employees collaborate by asking questions, sharing updates, and learning from peers.

- Example (India): Threads like “How to transfer EPF to UAN,” “Gratuity eligibility after 5 years,” or “Best practices for flexi-benefits” help employees self-serve without raising a case.


### Alumni Service Center

A portal for ex-employees, contractors, and volunteers to stay connected and access content.

- Example (India): An ex-employee from Chennai requests an experience letter, accesses previous Form 16 copies, reads alumni news, and sees referral opportunities.


### Integrated chat and virtual agents

Built-in chat supports a basic bot and an advanced bot using **NLU** (natural language understanding) to interpret free text and assist.

- Example (India): Employee types, “Need help with PF transfer.” The bot provides steps, links the PF transfer form, offers to create a case, or escalates to a live HR agent if the issue is complex or sensitive (like a POSH concern).


### Knowledge articles

HR-created articles answer common questions and appear during search or while creating a case.

- Example (India): Articles like “How to update bank details,” “LTA rules,” “Gratuity calculation basics,” and “Leave encashment policy” are shown to employees. If an article likely solves the query, the system nudges the employee to read it before opening a case. HR agents also attach relevant articles when closing cases.


### Campaigns (targeted communications)

Run targeted, multi-channel communications for specific groups using audiences, bundles, and content.

- Example (India): After a merger, HR runs a campaign:
    - Audience: Mumbai office gets details on new office access, Bangalore office gets new parking procedures.
    - Managers get extra content on team change management.
    - Employees receive region-wise training invites, translated emails, and video links.
    - Only the right people get the right messages at the right time.


### Email to case and AI categorization

Emails to HR can auto-create cases. With predictive intelligence, the system auto-categorizes and assigns them.

- Example (India): An email with subject “Issue with Sodexo/meal card” becomes a case categorized as “Benefits—Meal Cards” and routes directly to the benefits owner, reducing manual triage.


### Lifecycle Events

Use **Lifecycle Events** to automate multi-step HR journeys like onboarding, transfers, leave, or exit.

- Example (India) Onboarding:
    - Day -5: Send welcome pack, first-day agenda, HR contact.
    - Day 1: Collect Aadhaar/PAN for records, assign IT assets, complete policy acknowledgements.
    - Day 3: Assign compliance trainings (code of conduct, info security).
    - Day 7: Benefits briefing (EPF, ESI if applicable, insurance nomination).
    - Day 30: Goal setting with manager and feedback check-in.
- Each step triggers on time, with reminders and escalations if tasks are delayed.


### Integrations (DocuSign)

Pre-built integrations connect HR with tools like **DocuSign** for secure digital signatures and tamper-proof documents.

- Example (India): HR sends an offer letter via DocuSign to a candidate in Bengaluru. The candidate signs digitally, the hiring manager countersigns, and the signed PDF is automatically stored in the employee’s document record with proof of authenticity and no changes allowed.


### Putting it all together

- An employee in Gurgaon opens the portal or app, searches an article, chats with the bot, or raises a case.
- The case auto-routes to the right HR expert; tasks and documents are handled with proper retention and legal controls.
- Managers see what’s pending in Manager Hub; employees get updates via portal, email, or app.
- HR monitors performance via dashboards and trends, runs targeted campaigns when needed, and uses lifecycle events for complex journeys.
- Integrations like DocuSign ensure secure, legally valid signatures and seamless document flow.

# Complete HR Service Delivery Features Guide with Detailed Indian Examples

This comprehensive guide covers every feature mentioned in the transcript with detailed explanations and India-specific examples to ensure complete understanding.

## Core Case Management

### HR Cases - Complete Documentation System

HR cases serve as digital containers that capture every detail of an employee's request from start to finish, including notes, interactions, tasks, and resolution steps.

**Detailed Indian Example 1:** Rajesh from the Mumbai office needs to update his PAN card details in the system. HR creates a case with:

- Initial request details and reason for change
- Notes from phone conversation about required documents
- Task assigned to payroll team to update PAN in salary system
- Task assigned to compliance team to update PAN in TDS records
- Communication log showing Rajesh was asked to submit new PAN card copy
- Attachment of new PAN card document
- Confirmation notes when updates were completed in both payroll and compliance systems
- Final closure note with reference numbers for future tracking

**Detailed Indian Example 2:** Priya from Bangalore raises a maternity leave case. The HR case includes:

- Original application with expected delivery date
- Medical certificate from doctor
- Tasks for HR to calculate leave entitlement under Maternity Benefit Act
- Manager approval workflow
- Payroll notification for salary processing during leave
- Communication about handover procedures
- Updates about leave extension if needed
- Return-to-work planning and documentation


### Auto Case Assignments - Skill-Based Intelligent Routing

The system automatically directs cases to HR agents based on their certified skills and specializations, ensuring expert handling from the start.

**Detailed Indian Example 1:** The system recognizes different case types:

- **EPF/PF Transfer case** → Auto-assigned to Sunita (certified in PF regulations and EPFO procedures)
- **POSH Complaint case** → Auto-assigned to Vikram (trained in Prevention of Sexual Harassment protocols and IC procedures)
- **Tax/Form 16 Query** → Auto-assigned to Meera (specialized in income tax and TDS regulations)
- **Visa/Immigration case** → Auto-assigned to Kiran (expert in H1B, L1, and other visa processes)

**Detailed Indian Example 2:** Skills are built and assigned systematically:

- New HR agent Rohit joins and initially handles only general queries
- After completing EPF training, he gets "PF Specialist" skill added to his profile
- Cases mentioning "EPF withdrawal," "PF transfer," or "UAN issues" now route to him
- As he gains experience, additional skills like "Gratuity Calculator" and "Leave Policies" are added
- The system ensures workload balance among agents with similar skills


### HR Bulk Case Requests - System-Wide Issue Management

When a common problem affects multiple employees, bulk cases prevent system overload and ensure consistent communication.

**Detailed Indian Example 1:** Payroll System Failure Scenario

- Diwali bonus processing fails, affecting 2,500 employees across Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore offices
- Instead of 2,500 individual cases, HR creates one bulk case: "Diwali Bonus Processing Failure - October 2025"
- All affected employees are linked to this single case automatically
- HR posts one update: "Issue identified, bonus will be processed by October 30th"
- System sends SMS/email to all 2,500 employees simultaneously
- When resolved, one case closure triggers notifications to everyone
- Individual employees can still comment or ask specific questions within the bulk case

**Detailed Indian Example 2:** ESI Registration Issue

- New ESI regulations require all employees earning below ₹25,000 to re-register
- Affects 800 employees across Chennai and Hyderabad
- Bulk case created with title "ESI Re-registration - New Wage Ceiling Implementation"
- Targeted communication sent only to affected employees with specific forms and deadlines
- Progress tracked centrally - HR can see how many have completed registration
- Automated reminders sent to those who haven't submitted documents


## Document Management Solutions

### Employee Document Management - Advanced Document Control System

This premium add-on provides sophisticated document lifecycle management with legal compliance features.

**Detailed Indian Example 1:** Comprehensive Document Control

- **Offer Letters:** 7-year retention policy, requires candidate signature, HR signature, and hiring manager approval
- **NDAs:** 10-year retention, tracks who signed when, automatic renewal reminders
- **Background Verification Reports:** 5-year retention, restricted access only to authorized HR personnel
- **Form 16 and Tax Documents:** Permanent retention with legal hold capabilities during IT department audits
- **Performance Appraisal Forms:** 3-year retention, manager and employee signatures required

**Detailed Indian Example 2:** Legal Hold Functionality

# Complete HR Service Delivery Features Guide

This comprehensive guide covers every feature mentioned in the transcript with detailed explanations and practical examples to ensure complete understanding.

## Core Case Management

### HR Cases - Complete Documentation System

HR cases are comprehensive digital containers that serve as the central repository for all employee requests and HR interactions. They function as electronic files that capture, organize, and track every aspect of an employee's inquiry from initial submission through final resolution. The system includes capabilities for note-taking, direct employee communication, task assignment, document attachment, status tracking, and audit trail maintenance. HR cases ensure that no information is lost, all interactions are documented, and cases can be efficiently managed, transferred, and referenced for future needs.

**Example 1:** Rajesh from the Mumbai office needs to update his PAN card details in the system. HR creates a case with initial request details and reason for change, notes from phone conversation about required documents, task assigned to payroll team to update PAN in salary system, task assigned to compliance team to update PAN in TDS records, communication log showing Rajesh was asked to submit new PAN card copy, attachment of new PAN card document, confirmation notes when updates were completed in both payroll and compliance systems, and final closure note with reference numbers for future tracking.

**Example 2:** Priya from Bangalore raises a maternity leave case. The HR case includes original application with expected delivery date, medical certificate from doctor, tasks for HR to calculate leave entitlement under Maternity Benefit Act, manager approval workflow, payroll notification for salary processing during leave, communication about handover procedures, updates about leave extension if needed, and return-to-work planning and documentation.

### Auto Case Assignments - Skill-Based Intelligent Routing

Auto case assignment is an intelligent routing mechanism that automatically directs newly created HR cases to the most appropriate HR agent based on predefined skills, certifications, specializations, and workload capacity. The system maintains a comprehensive skills matrix for each HR agent, which includes their expertise areas, certification levels, language capabilities, and current case load. When a case is created, the system analyzes the case content, category, complexity, and urgency level, then matches these requirements against available agents' skills and availability to ensure optimal assignment without manual intervention.

**Example 1:** The system recognizes different case types and routes accordingly: EPF/PF Transfer cases auto-assign to Sunita (certified in PF regulations and EPFO procedures), POSH Complaint cases go to Vikram (trained in Prevention of Sexual Harassment protocols and IC procedures), Tax/Form 16 queries route to Meera (specialized in income tax and TDS regulations), and Visa/Immigration cases assign to Kiran (expert in H1B, L1, and other visa processes).

**Example 2:** Skills are built and assigned systematically. New HR agent Rohit joins and initially handles only general queries. After completing EPF training, he gets "PF Specialist" skill added to his profile. Cases mentioning "EPF withdrawal," "PF transfer," or "UAN issues" now route to him. As he gains experience, additional skills like "Gratuity Calculator" and "Leave Policies" are added. The system ensures workload balance among agents with similar skills.

### HR Bulk Case Requests - System-Wide Issue Management

HR bulk case requests are specialized case management tools designed to handle widespread issues that affect multiple employees simultaneously. Instead of creating hundreds or thousands of individual cases for the same underlying problem, the system creates one master case that represents all affected employees. This approach prevents system overload, ensures consistent communication, reduces administrative burden, and provides unified resolution tracking. Bulk cases maintain links to all affected employees while allowing for individualized responses when necessary.

**Example 1:** Payroll System Failure Scenario - Diwali bonus processing fails, affecting 2,500 employees across Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore offices. Instead of 2,500 individual cases, HR creates one bulk case: "Diwali Bonus Processing Failure - October 2025." All affected employees are linked to this single case automatically. HR posts one update: "Issue identified, bonus will be processed by October 30th." System sends SMS/email to all 2,500 employees simultaneously. When resolved, one case closure triggers notifications to everyone. Individual employees can still comment or ask specific questions within the bulk case.

**Example 2:** ESI Registration Issue - New ESI regulations require all employees earning below ₹25,000 to re-register, affecting 800 employees across Chennai and Hyderabad. Bulk case created with title "ESI Re-registration - New Wage Ceiling Implementation." Targeted communication sent only to affected employees with specific forms and deadlines. Progress tracked centrally - HR can see how many have completed registration. Automated reminders sent to those who haven't submitted documents.

## Document Management Solutions

### Employee Document Management - Advanced Document Control System

Employee Document Management is a premium subscription application that provides comprehensive control over HR-related documents throughout their entire lifecycle. The system manages document creation, routing, approval workflows, signature collection, version control, access permissions, retention policies, legal holds, audit trails, and secure storage. It handles various document types including contracts, NDAs, policies, forms, certificates, and compliance materials. The system ensures legal compliance, maintains document integrity, provides tamper-proof storage, and supports complex approval workflows with multiple stakeholders.

**Example 1:** Comprehensive Document Control includes Offer Letters with 7-year retention policy requiring candidate signature, HR signature, and hiring manager approval; NDAs with 10-year retention that tracks who signed when with automatic renewal reminders; Background Verification Reports with 5-year retention and restricted access only to authorized HR personnel; Form 16 and Tax Documents with permanent retention and legal hold capabilities during IT department audits; and Performance Appraisal Forms with 3-year retention requiring manager and employee signatures.

**Example 2:** Legal Hold Functionality - Employee Amit files a wrongful termination case against the company. HR immediately places legal hold on all of Amit's documents. His offer letter, performance reviews, disciplinary actions, emails, and exit documentation become read-only. No one can edit, delete, or modify these documents during legal proceedings. System maintains audit trail showing who accessed what document when. Legal hold remains until court case is resolved.

**Example 3:** Multi-level Signing Process - New employee Deepika's onboarding requires multiple signatures: Deepika signs offer letter acceptance, hiring manager signs budget approval, HR manager signs policy acknowledgment receipt, and compliance officer signs background verification clearance. System tracks signature sequence and sends automatic reminders for pending signatures.

## Analytics and Performance Tracking

### HR Dashboards vs Platform Analytics - Data Visualization and Analysis Systems

HR Dashboards and Platform Analytics serve different but complementary purposes in HR data management. Dashboards provide real-time, static snapshots of current HR metrics, displaying information in tables, charts, and summary formats that show the current state of HR operations at any given moment. Platform Analytics, in contrast, collects and analyzes data over extended periods to identify trends, patterns, seasonality, and performance improvements. Analytics can predict future patterns, identify anomalies, track long-term performance changes, and provide insights for strategic decision-making.


| Feature | HR Dashboards (Reports) | HR Platform Analytics (Trends) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Data Type** | Static snapshot | Historical trends over time |
| **Purpose** | Current status monitoring | Pattern identification and prediction |
| **View Format** | Tables, counts, lists | Charts, graphs, trend lines |
| **Time Frame** | Point-in-time | Longitudinal analysis |

**Dashboards Example:** Today's Snapshot shows 127 open cases, 45 closed this week, 12 pending manager approvals. Current Metrics display average resolution time of 4.2 days and employee satisfaction score of 4.1/5. Active Cases by Type break down as 35 leave requests, 28 salary queries, 20 benefits questions, 18 policy clarifications, and 26 others.

**Platform Analytics Example:** Seasonal Trends show leave requests increase 300% during Diwali week and benefits queries spike 250% during April-May tax season. Performance Improvement data reveals case resolution time decreased from 8.5 days (Jan 2025) to 4.2 days (Sept 2025). Pattern Recognition identifies that Monday mornings see 40% more case creation while Friday afternoons have lowest HR response rates. Predictive Insights suggest expecting 500+ Form 16 requests between March 15-31, 2026 based on historical data.

The hub provides real-time visibility into team status, pending approvals, performance metrics, compliance requirements, budget utilization, and upcoming deadlines.

Employee Forums are social collaboration spaces integrated within the Employee Center Pro that enable peer-to-peer knowledge sharing, community building, and collaborative problem-solving. These standard forum platforms allow employees to post questions, share experiences, read blogs, watch videos, participate in discussions, and learn from colleagues across the organization. Forums are moderated by HR teams and subject matter experts, with popular discussions often converted into official knowledge base articles.

**Example 1:** Popular Forum Categories include "Tax and Investments" where employees share 80C investment strategies, home loan tax benefits, and NPS discussions; "Parental Support" where new parents discuss maternity/paternity leave experiences, childcare recommendations, and work-life balance tips; "Relocation Help" featuring inter-city transfer experiences, traffic tips, housing suggestions, and culture insights; "Learning and Development" with course recommendations, certification experiences, and conference attendance feedback.

**Example 2:** Real Forum Interactions begin with questions like "Has anyone used the sabbatical leave policy? What was the approval process?" followed by responses from 12 employees sharing experiences, approval timelines, documentation needed, and manager conversation tips. HR team members participate by clarifying policy updates and providing official documentation links. Popular questions get converted into official knowledge base articles for broader access.

### Alumni Service Center (ASC) - Extended Network Portal

The Alumni Service Center is a specialized portal designed to maintain ongoing relationships with former employees, contractors, volunteers, and other external stakeholders who remain connected to the organization. It provides unique content and services tailored to different user types, enabling continued engagement, knowledge sharing, referral opportunities, and access to relevant services even after employment ends. The portal maintains appropriate security boundaries while fostering long-term professional relationships.

**Example 1:** Ex-Employee Services - Rajesh, former TCS employee now at Infosys, accesses portal to download previous years' Form 16 for ITR filing, requests experience letter with specific role descriptions for visa application, stays updated on TCS alumni network events in Pune, and refers qualified candidates through alumni referral program.

**Example 2:** Contractor and Vendor Access enables Freelance Trainers to access training materials, submit invoices, and download TDS certificates; Security Guards (Contract Staff) to view duty rosters, submit leave requests, and access safety training materials; Cleaning Staff Contractors to access health and safety protocols, submit feedback, and view payment schedules; Volunteer Contributors to access project guidelines, submit time logs, and download certificates of participation.

## Advanced Communication and Automation Features

### Integrated Chat and Virtual Agents - Multi-Layer Support System

The integrated chat system provides sophisticated, multi-tiered support through chatbots and AI-powered virtual agents. Basic virtual agents handle straightforward queries using predefined responses and decision trees, while advanced systems utilize Natural Language Understanding (NLU) machine learning to provide human-like interactions. The system can escalate conversations to live HR agents, create cases automatically, suggest relevant knowledge articles, and maintain conversation context across multiple interactions. Machine learning capabilities enable continuous improvement in response accuracy and user satisfaction.

**Example 1:** Basic Virtual Agent Interactions - Employee queries "How many leaves do I have remaining?" Bot responds "You have 12 annual leaves and 6 sick leaves remaining. Would you like to apply for leave?" Follow-up provides leave application link and policy document. If employee asks complex policy interpretation, bot transfers to live HR agent.

**Example 2:** Advanced AI-Powered Conversations - Employee inputs "I'm worried about my appraisal rating and think my manager is biased." AI Understanding recognizes sensitive performance and potential conflict issue. Intelligent Response states "I understand you have concerns about your performance review. This seems like something that needs personalized attention. Let me connect you with our employee relations specialist who can discuss this confidentially." Smart Routing automatically escalates case to trained counselor with confidential flag.

**Example 3:** Multi-Language Support - Employee asks in Hindi "Mujhe apna EPF number chahiye" (I need my EPF number). AI Processing understands Hindi, translates context, and provides response. System provides EPF number in preferred language, offers additional PF-related services, and learns to improve Hindi understanding through machine learning from interactions.

### Knowledge Articles - Self-Service Information Repository

Knowledge Articles constitute a comprehensive, searchable database of information created and maintained by HR administrators and designated knowledge managers. These articles provide instant answers to common employee questions, reduce case volume, and ensure consistent information delivery. The system uses various search methods including machine learning algorithms to present the most relevant articles based on user queries, security permissions, and context. Articles can be attached to case resolutions, suggested during case creation, and continuously updated based on usage analytics and employee feedback.

**Example 1:** Article Creation and Usage - HR creates "Complete Guide to EPF Withdrawal Process" including step-by-step withdrawal process, required documents, timeline expectations, and online vs offline procedures. Smart Suggestions show this article when employee types "EPF withdrawal" before case creation. Usage Tracking shows article viewed 847 times, reducing EPF-related cases by 60%. Continuous Updates occur quarterly with latest EPFO rule changes.

**Example 2:** Security-Based Article Access provides Public Articles about general leave policies, holiday calendars, and basic benefits information; Employee-Only Articles covering salary structures, performance bonus calculations, and internal job posting procedures; Manager Articles with team management guidelines, disciplinary action procedures, and budget approval processes; HR-Only Articles containing compliance checklists, audit procedures, and sensitive policy interpretations.

**Example 3:** Case Resolution Integration - During case closure, HR agent attaches "Maternity Leave Complete Guide" to resolved case. Employee benefit includes comprehensive information for future reference. Knowledge Sharing makes article available in Employee Center Pro for all pregnant employees. Feedback Loop uses employee feedback on article quality to improve content.

### Campaigns - Targeted Multi-Channel Communication System

Campaigns represent a sophisticated communication platform designed to distribute specific, targeted content to precisely defined employee groups. The system operates through audiences (which define recipient groups), bundles (which organize related content), and content delivery mechanisms (emails, videos, documents, meeting invitations). This approach ensures that different employee segments receive relevant, timely, and appropriate information while maintaining centralized control over messaging consistency and delivery tracking.

**Example 1:** Post-Merger Communication Campaign - TechMahindra acquires smaller firm "InnovateIT" with complex audience segmentation. Audience 1 (TechMahindra Employees) receives welcome message about new team members and information about expanded service offerings with no action required. Audience 2 (InnovateIT Employees - Bangalore) gets new company policies, TechMahindra benefits enrollment with EPF transfer guidance, office integration timeline with new ID card procedures, and mandatory training on TechMahindra systems and security protocols. Audience 3 (InnovateIT Employees - Mumbai) receives same as Bangalore but with Mumbai-specific office relocation details, local HR contact information, and office tour introductions. Audience 4 (Managers from Both Companies) gets change management training modules, new reporting structure guidelines, team integration best practices, and budget allocation updates. Content delivery includes email bundles with 5 emails over 2 weeks, video content with CEO welcome messages and system training tutorials, document packages with handbooks and forms, and meeting invitations for department-wise integration meetings.

**Example 2:** Annual Tax Planning Campaign helps employees with 80C investment planning before financial year end. Audience Segmentation includes New Employees (< 1 year) receiving basic tax planning introduction and company tax benefits explanation; Mid-level Employees (1-5 years) getting advanced investment options, home loan benefits, and HRA optimization; Senior Employees (> 5 years) accessing NPS benefits, senior citizen parent tax benefits, and capital gains planning; HR Team receiving tools and resources to answer employee tax queries. Content Distribution spans Month 1 with educational articles about tax planning basics, Month 2 with interactive webinar invitations based on employee level, Month 3 with personalized tax calculator tools and consultation booking links, and Final Week with urgent reminders including direct links to investment platforms and form downloads.

### Email Integration and Predictive Intelligence

Email integration capabilities automatically convert incoming HR emails into cases while predictive intelligence uses machine learning to enhance this process through automatic categorization and intelligent assignment. The basic system creates general inquiry cases that require manual review and assignment, while advanced AI-powered systems analyze email content, recognize patterns, determine appropriate categories, and assign cases to the most suitable agents immediately upon receipt.

**Example 1:** Basic Email-to-Case Process - Employee sends email to hr@company.com with subject "Need help with EPF transfer." Auto-Case Creation produces general inquiry case \#HRC-2025-09-001. Manual Processing requires HR agent to review email, recategorize as "Benefits - EPF," and assign to EPF specialist. Resolution involves specialist handling case and responding to employee. Timeline takes 4-6 hours for proper assignment.

**Example 2:** AI-Enhanced Email Processing handles same email "Need help with EPF transfer" with AI Analysis that recognizes "EPF," "transfer," and identifies employee's current status. Smart Categorization automatically labels as "Benefits - EPF Transfer." Instant Assignment directly routes to EPF specialist Sunita. Enhanced Context includes employee's service details, previous EPF interactions, and relevant policy links. Timeline requires under 10 minutes for proper assignment and context building.

**Example 3:** Complex Email Analysis handles email content "Hi, I got married last month and need to update my nominee details for insurance and also want to know about family medical benefits for my spouse. Also, can you help me understand the tax implications?" AI Recognition identifies multiple topics: nominee change, insurance, medical benefits, tax implications, and marital status update. Smart Processing creates one comprehensive case covering all topics, assigns to benefits specialist, and flags for tax advisor consultation. Proactive Service attaches relevant articles about post-marriage benefit updates.

### Lifecycle Events - Complex Process Automation

Lifecycle Events are structured automation systems specifically designed to handle complex, multi-step HR processes that require precise sequencing, timing, and task management. Unlike standard HR cases, Lifecycle Events manage series of interdependent activities that must occur in specific order and timeframes. They automate task creation, assignment, reminders, escalations, and progress tracking while ensuring nothing falls through the cracks during complex HR processes like onboarding, transfers, performance management, or offboarding.

**Example 1:** Complete New Employee Onboarding Lifecycle spans Pre-Joining Phase (Days -7 to 0) with Day -7 sending welcome email with first-day instructions, office address, and reporting manager contact; Day -5 sharing company culture video, employee handbook, and first-week schedule; Day -3 providing IT equipment assignment email, parking allocation, and cafeteria meal card setup; Day -1 sending reminder email with document checklist, dress code guidelines. First Week (Days 1-7) includes Day 1 with office tour task assigned to buddy/mentor, ID card photo and creation, Aadhaar and PAN collection for compliance, basic safety orientation completion, and manager introduction meeting scheduled; Day 2 with IT system access setup and training, email account activation with initial password setup, company intranet navigation training, and emergency contact information collection; Day 3 featuring benefits enrollment session (medical insurance, EPF, ESI if applicable), nominee details submission for all benefits, salary account opening assistance if needed, and company policies acknowledgment; Day 5 including role-specific training module assignments, department introduction meetings, project assignment and goal setting discussion, and mentor check-in meeting. First Month Continuation covers Day 14 with mid-month feedback session addressing concerns or questions, Day 21 with skills assessment and additional training identification, and Day 30 with month-end review with manager, goal finalization, and probation period expectations.

**Example 2:** Employee Transfer Lifecycle (Bangalore to Mumbai) begins with Pre-Transfer Phase (30 days before) including Day -30 transfer approval notification and relocation benefits explanation; Day -25 Mumbai office facilities introduction and local HR contact assignment; Day -20 relocation vendor coordination and household goods survey scheduling; Day -15 travel arrangements and temporary accommodation booking if needed; Day -10 asset handover checklist (laptop, ID card, any Bangalore office materials); Day -7 final handover meetings and project transition documentation; Day -3 farewell coordination and exit interviews with Bangalore team. Transfer Week includes Day 0 with travel day, accommodation check-in, and arrival confirmation; Day 1 with Mumbai office reporting, local induction, and new seating arrangement; Day 2 with local compliance updates (address proof, local PF office change); Day 3 with team introductions and Mumbai-specific orientation; Day 5 with feedback session about relocation process and addressing settlement issues. Post-Transfer (30-90 days) covers Day 30 with settlement review and reimbursement claim processing; Day 60 with performance check-in with new manager and team integration assessment; Day 90 with complete transfer success evaluation and lifecycle event closure.
